    This notebook demonstrates the relationship between an input variable and its calculated outputs.

    ### Current Values:
    - **Selected value (x):** {slider.value}
    - **Squared value (xÂ²):** {x_squared}

    *Change the slider's position to see how the output text updates in real-time.*
